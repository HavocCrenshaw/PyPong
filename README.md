# PyPong
Learning Python project. I taught somebody how to code with Python recently, and
the project we made was this. I was more so focusing on fundementals of
programming, not actually using Python to some of it's full capability, so we
didn't worry about a lot of things and cover a lot of Python features. After
making it, I was like "heck yeah, I wanna try this to my own abilities" and made
this. This is about a good maybe, 12 hours spread over two days. Did I use a ton
of Python features? No, but I made a nice game.

To add: AI, maybe slower ball in opening
